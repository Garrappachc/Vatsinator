--- source/ui/resources ---

This directory contains all the images needed for the ui to work properly and
be beautiful. All icons that are included in the application should be placed
here and attached to the .qrc file. The only exception are aircrafts pixmaps
as they should be replaceable by user.
Notice that pixmaps that are being rendered directly by OpenGL must be sized
so their dimensions can be expressed as a power of two. This is due to old
OpenGL implementations where non-POT textures are not rendered correctly.
