/**
 * The MapItem is a base class for map objects that are points. Each item has
 * its \c position that determines whether it needs to be drawn or not.
 * The \c isVisible() method is an additional requirement that can eliminate
 * items from being drawn. For example, all \c AirportItems that represent
 * an empty airport will be hidden (with the default settings). The
 * \c tooltipText() method returns a string for the tooltip that is visible
 * whether user puts the mouse cursor over the item. The \c showDetails()
 * method opens new view represeting the particular item's details.
 * 
 * To show areas on the map, look for \c MapArea class.
