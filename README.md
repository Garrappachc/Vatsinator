**Vatsinator** is an open-source Vatsim network monitor. It shows logged-in pilots and controllers, provides weather and airport information. Vatsinator is designed to be quick and handy, in order to be useful on desktops (when not flying) and note/netbooks (during flight).

Vatsinator uses QT libraries for GUI and OpenGL as a map rendering engine. Currently we can run this application on Linux and Windows. We are looking for MacOS package maintainers.
