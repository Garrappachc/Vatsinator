**Vatsinator** is an open-source Vatsim network monitor. It shows logged-in pilots and controllers, provides weather and airport information. Vatsinator is designed to be quick and handy, in order to be useful on desktops (when not flying) and note/netbooks (during flight).

Vatsinator uses QT libraries for GUI and OpenGL as a map rendering engine. Currently we can run this application on Linux and Windows. We are looking for MacOS package maintainers.

**To avoid confusion** Vatsinator does NOT show real-life traffic. It is only VATSIM (Virtual Air Traffic Simulation) network monitor. To find out what VATSIM is, see [http://www.vatsim.net](http://www.vatsim.net/).
